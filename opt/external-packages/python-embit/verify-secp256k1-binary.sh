# embit's secp256k1 must be the pre-compiled libsecp256k1 and there must be no
# trace of the pure python secp256k1 fallback.
#
# Two things can go wrong, and they are not equally visible:
#
#   - libsecp256k1 is missing or unusable. embit raises at import and the app
#     never starts. Loud, but much better caught at build time than on first
#     boot. Checks 2-4.
#
#   - The pure python fallback is back in the image. Now if the library ever
#     fails to load, embit no longer raises -- it quietly signs with python
#     instead, on a device that looks and behaves like a working one. Check 1.
